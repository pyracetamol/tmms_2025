This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for simulating classical models in computational materials science.

What You'll Find Here:

Jupyter notebooks implementing:
  - Cahn-Hilliard equation (spinodal decomposition, phase separation)
  - Allen-Cahn equation (grain growth, coarsening)
  - Spectral methods with dealiasing (FFT-based solvers)
  - Energy tracking during simulation
  - Microstructure visualization with snapshots and area fraction plots
