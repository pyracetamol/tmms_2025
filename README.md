This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for simulating classical models in computational materials science.

What You'll Find Here:

Jupyter notebooks implementing:
  - Cahn-Hilliard Equation (spinodal decomposition, phase separation)
  - Allen-Cahn Equation (grain growth, coarsening)
  - Spectral Methods with dealiasing (FFT-based solvers)
  - Energy Tracking during simulation
  - Microstructure Visualization with snapshots and area fraction plots
