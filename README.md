This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for simulating classical models in computational materials science.

What You'll Find Here:

- Phase field models
  - Cahn-Hilliard equation (spinodal decomposition, phase separation)
  - Allen-Cahn equation (grain growth, coarsening)
- Molecular dynamics simulations
  - Simulations of stress-strain behavior under mechanical loading
  - Temperature-dependent diffusivity
- Monte Carlo simulations
  - 2D Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm and analysis of thermodynamic quantities
- Calphad simulations via PyCalphad
  - Thermodynamic calculations based on assessed databases
  - Phase diagram construction and equilibrium analysis
