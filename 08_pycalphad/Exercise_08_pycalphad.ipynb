    "# Exercise: (Py)Calphad\n",
    "\n",
    "After working with atomistic simulations, we now shift our focus to a thermodynamic approach. While atomistic methods provide detailed insights into atomic interactions and short-range phenomena, they often fall short in efficiently predicting long-range phase stability and equilibria in complex, multicomponent systems. To address these challenges, we now move to the **CALPHAD** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "CALPHAD, which stands for *CALculation of PHAse Diagrams*, is a computational methodology used to model and predict phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of multicomponent materials systems. *It combines experimental data, thermodynamic principles, and mathematical models to construct databases that describe how materials behave under varying conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally developed to aid in alloy design and metallurgy, CALPHAD has since expanded into ceramics, polymers, and other complex materials. By providing accurate phase diagrams and property predictions, CALPHAD supports materials research, engineering, and development by reducing the need for extensive experimental trials. Its models are widely used in both academic research and industrial applications such as process optimization and new material design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before addressing the main tasks, let’s go through a quick tutorial to get familiar with the basic features of the CALPHAD approach."
